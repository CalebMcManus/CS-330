REFLECTION
How do I approach designing software?-

I approach software desgin by breaking it down into what the goals it needs to achieve, by building it piece by piece that way, it allows me to test as a I go 
and make sure all pieces are compatable and built properly that way.

How do I approach developing programs?

I've learn to do a bit of research from this project as I have never done anything like this before. Being able to understand the functions of the libraries I'm using
to build a full independent program will be of major help. I wouldn't say my approuch has changed much seeing as I normally break down the goals to more easier to understand parts anyway.

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

I have a deep interest in machine learning and AI, with the addition to my studdies of that and visualizations, I would be able to potentially create AR or VR assets to assist
the ai or user in completing goals and making interfaces within programs.
